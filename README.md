# A dataset of Snow-road

The images in this dataset are of actual road scenes captured while unmanned vehicle driving.

If this dataset is provided for research purposes, please see License section below.


## Files
Currently the dataset contains 6000 infrared images, visible light images and ground-truth depth maps.

```
-----------------------------------------------------
infrared images         | 6000 | 7.40M tokens
visible light images    | 6000 |  396K tokens
ground-truth depth maps | 6000 | 1.11M tokens
-----------------------------------------------------
```

## Format
The infrared images, visible light images and depth maps are cut into the resolution of 256Ã—512.
In addition, training and testing labels are generated by classifying the depth map into 32 levels in the logarithmic space
